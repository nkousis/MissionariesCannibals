How to run:

Use terminal and navigate to the project file's bin folder (MissionairiesCannibals\bin).
An example would be C:\Users\UserName\Desktop\MissionairiesCannibals\bin

Type "java -cp" to compile the program and then run it.

In case any of this doesn't work, a jar is included, and the code, and you can always run it in an IDE if all else fails.
